## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (do a count till christmas day, my tweak though, cause you know christmas is here)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git and GitHub

### What I learnt

I have been reading up a couple of articles/books on the importance of semantic HTML and the very many benefits it offers, accessibility being one of major benefits. So currently I try as much to give my HTML structure enough semantic as much as I possibly can; that involves me always asking myself which HTML tag would best semantically convey the importance of every section on the webpage, while ensuring I use alt attributes for images and try to ensure the document flow is in other. Hey yo, I'm probably not yet a 100% complaint but I believe I would keep getting better as I remain more conscious of it. For this project, here is a top-level break down of the semantic layout.

```html
<header> Contains the page's header message </header>
<main> All the awesome timer stuff went in here </main>
<footer> Contains the social media links </footer>
```

The laying out of the page's background was an interesting learning process for me. It provided a good use case for me to implement the ::before and ::after CSS pseudo-selector.  I used the ::before to layout the stars svg on the background while the ::after, I used to layout the hills svg on the background. It was really helpful in providing some level of structure without affecting the markup of the document. The background of the page used a linear gradient that flowed between two colors from top to bottom.

The entire page was layed out using the CSS3 grid display property. I have just learnt about CSS grid a couple of weeks ago and decided to test it out with this project, I used 3 rows / 1 column template. It did provide a neat control of the page's flow without much media queries. I'm still trying to wrap my heads around some of the custom units it provides such as: fit-content, auto-fill, minmax() etc. and its use-cases. 

####Code Snippet for the grid:
```css
.grid {
  //other styles
  display: grid;
  grid-template: 0.3fr minmax(6.25rem, 0.2fr) 0.5fr / 1fr;
}
```

Using google fonts to add custom fonts for my web projects has been a defacto for me. But I had tried accessing the google fonts website for while developing this project but all the time I tried the site would not open on my device, still researching what the issue is, but in the mean time, I decided to implement the custom 'Red Hat' font used for this project by dowloading it from font squirrel and using the @font-face selector. It provided a good work around but I noticed some lag whenever the page loads when I deployed it. 

####Code Snippet for custom Font:
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Red Hat";
  src: url("/font/red-hat/RedHatDisplay-Bold.otf") format("opentype");
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
